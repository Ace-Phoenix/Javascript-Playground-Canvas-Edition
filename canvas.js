// im going to have you guys figure out how to make the circle work with corners because currently it has
//sad when it gets to a corner also this shows when i changed the canvas to 400 400 so ge to it i guess


//few questions to answer because i want to know if you all know how my class works there are three questions just
//make another space put your name and then your answer


//Question One : How does the Asset class work? (MC)
//a. it doesn't
//b. it only makes parameters for an object
//c. it makes the parameters and draws the object
//d. none of the above



//Question Two : What is the width of the canvas i use and how do you change it
//


//Question Three : Do you understand my code or do I have to explain all of it? (y/n/m)
//Yes?
//No?
//Maybe?//Maybe will need to be explained



//These question are just so that i know that all of you know how my code works so far to make and draw objects
//and with easy access to remove the object when you need to and update and change it when needed :)
